# CIFAR10-CNN-Image-Classifier
CIFAR10-CNN-Image-Classifier

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It uses data augmentation and batch normalization to improve model performance. The model is trained and evaluated to achieve high accuracy.

Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

JAX

NumPy

Matplotlib

SciPy

OpenCV (optional for image processing)

You can install the required libraries using:

pip install tensorflow jax numpy matplotlib scipy opencv-python

Running the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CIFAR10-CNN-Image-Classifier.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd CIFAR10-CNN-Image-Classifier

Run the Python script:

python cifar10_classifier.py

Model Training and Evaluation

The model trains using the CIFAR-10 dataset with data augmentation.

It evaluates performance on test data and prints accuracy.

The trained model can be improved by tweaking hyperparameters.

Output

After training, the model prints the final test accuracy.

The trained model can be used for further predictions.
